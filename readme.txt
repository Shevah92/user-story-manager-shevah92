Instructions:
You need to create a database.
Create a config.py containing:
    -dbname : Name of your database
    -name : Your username
    -host : The host of your database
    -password : your password (I'm not sure that is actually required, just add it for making sure)
    -address : the address you using for running the server eg: (http://localhost:5000/ you need to have the "/" at the end to make the code work)

run build.py
run main.py
Now you can test the code in a browser
When you finished open this http://goo.gl/AYNtQB (Don't worry, it's safe :D )
